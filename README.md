# Goscore

Go scoring API for Predictive Model Markup Language (PMML).

Currently supports Neural Network, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Models

Will be happy to implement new models by demand, or assist with any other issue.

Contact me here or at aschers@gmail.com.

## Installation

```
go get github.com/asafschers/goscore
```

## Usage

### Random Forest / Gradient Boosted Model

[Generate PMML - R](https://github.com/asafschers/scoruby/wiki)

Fetch model from PMML file -

```go
modelXml, _ := ioutil.ReadFile("fixtures/model.pmml")
var model goscore.RandomForest // or goscore.GradientBoostedModel
xml.Unmarshal([]byte(modelXml), &model)
```

Set features -

```go
features := map[string]any{
  "Sex": "male",
  "Parch": 0,
  "Age": 30,
  "Fare": 9.6875,
  "Pclass": 2,
  "SibSp": 0,
  "Embarked": "Q",
}
```

Score features by model -

```go
score, _ := model.Score(features, "1") // gbm.score doesn't recieve label
```

Score faster -

```go
runtime.GOMAXPROCS(runtime.NumCPU()) // use all cores
score, _ := model.ScoreConcurrently(features, "1") // parallelize tree traversing
```
